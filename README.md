# Gene Expression Classification Project

## Overview
This project analyzes gene expression data to classify individuals as healthy or sick and determine their specific pathology. Various feature selection methods and classifiers are applied to achieve optimal performance.
**This project is part of a hackathon in course 76558 at HUJI.**

## Data
- **Source:** Gene expression profiles of healthy and sick individuals.
- **Classes:**
  - Healthy
  - Sick (with specific pathologies)
- **Features:** Gene expression levels across multiple genes.

## Objectives
1. Identify the best features for classification.
2. Develop models to classify individuals as healthy or sick.
3. Determine the specific pathology in sick individuals.

## Methodology
1. **Feature Selection:**
   - Various feature selection techniques are evaluated to identify the most relevant genes.
2. **Classification Models:**
   - Multiple machine learning classifiers are tested to find the most accurate ones.
3. **Evaluation Metrics:**
   - Performance is assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization)


## Results
- The project reports the best-performing features and classifiers.
- Comparative analysis of different models based on evaluation metrics.

## Future Work
- Incorporate additional data sources for improved generalization.
- Explore deep learning approaches for enhanced accuracy.
